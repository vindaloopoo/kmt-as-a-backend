# KMT as a backend

Wow are we here again? The only reason for this is alleviating the AWS network costs/overhead

## Implementation

Deploy application orchestration (e.g. dokku et al) on AWS instances. This way we can use the KMT backend/model/etc while still "building on giants". i.e. symfony app with a kmt backend.
